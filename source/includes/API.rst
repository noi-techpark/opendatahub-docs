The APIs are composed of a few generic methods, that can be combined
with many parameters to retrieve only the relevant data and then
post-processed in the preferred way.

<https://tourism.opendatahub.com/swagger/ui/index>`_ or `mobility
<https://mobility.api.opendatahub.com/>`_ domains and execute a
query.
