Accessing the Open Data Hub
=============================

There are lots of alternatives to access the |odh| and its data:
interactive and non-interactive, using a browser or the command line.


Various dedicated tutorials are available in the :ref:`howto-list`
section to help you getting started, while in section
:ref:`getting-involved` you can find additional ways to collaborate
with the |odh| Team and use the data.


Browser access
--------------

Accessing data in the Open Data Hub by using a browser is useful on
different levels: for the casual user, who can have a look at the
type and quality of data provided; for a developer, that can use
the REST API implemented by the Open Data Hub or even check
if the results of his app are coherent with those retrieved with
the API; for everyone in order to get acquainted with the various
methods to retrieve data.

Besides the online tools developed by the |odh| and described in
section :ref:`quickstart`, these other resources can be access using a
browser.

Programmatic access
-------------------

Programmatic and non-interactive access to the Open Data Hub's dataset
is possible using any of the following methods made  available
